Simple Bluetooth Security System using Arduino : 
Components: 1- Arduino Uno
            2- Bluetooth HC-05/HC-06
            3- Green LED
            4- Red LED
            5- 2 100 ohms resistors 
            6- Wires (male/male jumpers)
            7- USB connection
            8- Breadboard
Android Software: Bluetooth HC-05/06 Terminal
